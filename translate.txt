  To change the language simply click:
      options -> languages and select a new language from the menu

Adding a Language 

 Creating the translation files

  Go to the src folder and open the directory tools. Simply run:
     "make"

  This will compile the gui. Once this is done you can run:
    ./create_language

  If you need to update the current language files open the update menu and click Update Translation Files.
 
  In order to add a language select the language from the drop down menu. Once a language has been selected the list
  of countries for that language will appear in the second drop down menu. If a language is dramatically different
  for a specific country then this is important.  

  An example of where it does not matter would be english. US english is understood by all english speakers. However
  for languages such as chinese, this could make a difference. 
 
  The appropriate .ts file will be created in /src/freeseer/frontend/default/languages
  

 Translating the Text 

  Open the language file created with step 1 or a previously existing .ts files
  with QT Linguist. You will be prompted to select the target language and the source
  language. Select english as the source language. 

  In the context area (left side bar). Under the context MainApp there is a single word
  'language_name'. This is where you put the name of the language that will appear in the language
  menu. Note: This must be filled in, in order for the language to appear in the menu

  The instructions for using QT Linguist can be found at:
    http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.1/linguist-translators.html  
   

 Creating the (.qm) files 

  Qt uses .qm files to translate the text at runtime. The files can be generated using 
  Qt Linguist. Once step 2 is complete, the qm file can be generated from the ts file by
  going to file -> release. This will create the .qm file with the correct name.
